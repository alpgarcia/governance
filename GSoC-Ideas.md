## Idea #x: Implementing CHAOSS metrics with Perceval

[ Micro-tasks and place for questions ](#)

### Description

The [GMD Working group](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd) is proposing some metrics
that are computed with information obtained from software development repositories.
One of the goals of the working group is to provide reference implementations of
those metrics, based on the output produced by [Perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval).
As an example, still work in progress, check the Python notebook with the
[reference implementation for commits](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/implementations/Code_Commits.ipynb).

The aims of this idea are as follows:

* Producing Python (Jupyter) notebooks with proposals for reference implementations
for these metrics. The proposals will follow the usual acceptance mechanism of the working group
(based on GitHub issues and pull requests). In general, all reference implementations will
build on the output produced by Perceval for the relevant data source,
and will explore the peculiarities of the metric and its implementation for that data source.

* Document the notebooks as much as possible, so that any person trying to implement the metric
can understand not only how to implement it, but also the details that should have into account.
Documentation should also be suitable for people willing to dig deeper about the details of
the metric, with the aim of understanding it (not necesarily implementing it).

* When needed, propose changes to Perceval, and maybe other components in GrimoireLab,
that allow for the implementation of the metric.

* Participate in the acceptance process of the working group.

The aims will require programming in Python, producing Python notebooks, interaction with other
people in the working group to learn about subtle details of the metrics, and producing
documentation.

  * _Difficulty:_ Medium
  * _Requirements:_ Python programming, experience with Python notebooks, skills for producing documentation.
  * _Recommended:_ Experience in data analytics with Python, if possible involving the use of Pandas, will be a plus. 
  * _Mentors:_ Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona and Valerio Cosentino.
